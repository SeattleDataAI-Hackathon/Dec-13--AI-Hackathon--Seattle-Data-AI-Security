* Mental Companion

Mental Companion is a personal growth and wellbeing web application that helps people reflect on their lives by talking to AI versions of themselves across time. Instead of giving generic advice, the system allows users to have conversations with their past self, present self, and future self, based entirely on their own thoughts, values, and experiences.

The goal of Mental Companion is to reduce self-doubt, overthinking, regret about past decisions, and anxiety about the future by turning self-reflection into an interactive experience.

** The problem

Many people struggle internally with questions they cannot easily answer. They overthink decisions, feel disconnected from their goals, carry regret from the past, or worry about where their life is heading. Journals are helpful but static, and advice apps often feel impersonal or disconnected from real context. What is missing is a way to reflect that feels personal, grounded, and interactive.

** The idea

Mental Companion is built around a simple idea: growth becomes easier when you can understand who you were, who you are, and who you want to become.

Users create three AI personas that represent different timelines of themselves. The past self reflects earlier fears, beliefs, and emotional experiences. The present self represents the user’s current reality, pressure, and uncertainty. The future self offers calm, long-term perspective based on the user’s values and goals.

All three personas are generated only from user-provided information. The AI does not invent identity or experiences.

** How it works

When a user starts, they answer a small set of reflective questions about their past, present, and future. These responses are used to build the internal datasets for each timeline.

After onboarding, the user can switch between past, present, and future selves and have conversations with each one. Every persona responds differently by design, reflecting the mindset and limitations of that timeline.

After each conversation, Mental Companion generates a short reflection summary. This includes the main emotional themes, repeating patterns, one grounded next step, and a gentle reminder aligned with the user’s values. A simple mental stability indicator is shown for awareness, not diagnosis.

** What Mental Companion helps with

Mental Companion helps users slow down their thinking, gain clarity, and reconnect with their goals. It supports people who feel stuck, uncertain, or anxious by helping them listen to their own perspective across time rather than relying on external advice.

** Technology

The application is built as a web-based chatbot using React and Tailwind CSS. The backend is designed to support OpenAI models with persona-controlled prompts. For the hackathon version, user data is stored locally in the browser. The system is structured so that authentication, encrypted storage, and a production backend can be added later.

** Safety and ethics

Mental Companion is designed as a wellbeing and self-reflection tool. It does not diagnose mental health conditions, provide medical advice, or replace professional support. The AI uses only information the user chooses to share and always responds in a calm, non-judgmental way.

DATE: September 19, 2024
VISIT TYPE: Physical Therapy - Session 12/12 (FINAL)

SUBJECTIVE: Patient reports pain is now 5/10 at best, but still present daily. Concerned about persistent symptoms despite 6 weeks of consistent PT.

OBJECTIVE: 
- Lumbar ROM improved to 80% of normal
- Persistent positive straight leg raise on left
- Core strength improved but still symptomatic

ASSESSMENT: Patient has completed 12 sessions of physical therapy over 6 weeks with only modest improvement. Persistent radicular symptoms suggest possible structural pathology.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 
- Patient has exhausted conservative PT approach
- Recommend MRI lumbar spine for further evaluation
- May need advanced intervention if structural lesion identified

PT DISCHARGE SUMMARY: Patient compliant with all 12 sessions. Performed home exercise program regularly. Despite good effort and compliance, continues to have significant pain and radicular symptoms. Further diagnostic workup warranted.

DATE: October 15, 2024
VISIT TYPE: Follow-up with Dr. Chen

SUBJECTIVE: Patient completed 6 weeks of PT (12 sessions) as prescribed. Reports continued pain 5/10, left leg radiating pain persists. Also tried Ibuprofen 600mg TID for 8 weeks with minimal relief.

OBJECTIVE:
- Still tender over L4-L5

- 6 weeks of supervised physical therapy (12 sessions)
- 8 week trial of NSAIDs (Ibuprofen 600mg TID)
- Activity modification
All with minimal improvement. Persistent radicular symptoms warrant advanced imaging.

PLAN:
Order MRI lumbar spine to evaluate for disc herniation or other structural pathology.
Continue NSAIDs as needed for pain.
Follow up after MRI results.

MRI ordered on 10/15/2024, performed on 10/20/2024.

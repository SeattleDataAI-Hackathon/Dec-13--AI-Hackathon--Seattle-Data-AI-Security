PATIENT: Jennifer Taylor
DOB: 04/12/1972 (Age 52)
MRN: 729841
INSURANCE: Cigna PPO

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Bilateral knee pain

52 yo female with progressively worsening bilateral knee pain x 3 years. Worse with stairs, prolonged standing, getting up from seated position. Stiffness in AM lasting ~30 min. Pain 6-7/10 daily. Interfering with work (retail manager - on feet most of day) and recreational activities (used to hike regularly, now unable).

PMH: Hypothyroidism, well-controlled on levothyroxine
PSH: None
Meds: Levothyroxine 100mcg daily, ibuprofen 400mg PRN (takes almost daily now)
Allergies: NKDA

EXAM:
Bilateral knees: Moderate effusions, crepitus with ROM, mild varus deformity, tender along medial joint lines bilaterally. ROM: 0-110 degrees bilaterally (normal 0-135).

X-RAYS (performed today): 
Bilateral knees show moderate degenerative changes, joint space narrowing medial compartments, osteophyte formation. Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3 osteoarthritis bilaterally.

ASSESSMENT: Bilateral knee osteoarthritis, moderate-severe

PLAN:
1. Start meloxicam 15mg daily (better GI profile than ibuprofen)
2. PT referral - focus on quadriceps strengthening, ROM exercises
3. Weight reduction counseling (BMI 32 - losing 10% body weight can improve symptoms)
4. Consider intra-articular cortisone if no improvement in 6-8 weeks
5. F/u 8 weeks

FOLLOW-UP VISIT

Patient completed 8 weeks of PT (2x/week). Has been doing home exercises. Lost 8 lbs (good progress!). Still having significant pain, 5-6/10 daily. Meloxicam helps some but not enough.

Discussed treatment options:
- Cortisone injections (may provide temporary relief, 3-6 months)
- Hyaluronic acid injections (covered by insurance, series of 3-5 injections)
- Long-term: may need knee replacement if conservative measures fail

Patient wants to try injections.

PLAN: Intra-articular cortisone injection, bilateral knees today

PROCEDURE: Bilateral knee arthrocentesis and corticosteroid injection
Informed consent obtained. Using sterile technique, 40mg triamcinolone + 2cc 1% lidocaine injected into each knee joint. No complications. Patient tolerated well.

PLAN: Follow up in 8-12 weeks to assess response

DATE: August 12, 2024  
FOLLOW-UP

Patient reports cortisone injections helped initially - had about 6 weeks of good relief, pain down to 3/10. But now back to baseline 6/10 pain. Disappointed that relief was temporary.

Discussed options:
1. Repeat cortisone (but diminishing returns with repeated injections)
2. Trial of hyaluronic acid injections (series of 5 weekly injections)
3. Consider surgical consultation for knee replacement

Patient not ready for surgery. Wants to try hyaluronic acid series.

PLAN: Schedule hyaluronic acid injection series (Synvisc-One) - covered by insurance

================================================================================
DATE: August 19, 2024
First Hyaluronic Acid Injection - RIGHT knee

Synvisc-One 6mL intra-articular injection right knee. Tolerated well.

================================================================================
DATE: August 26, 2024
First Hyaluronic Acid Injection - LEFT knee

Synvisc-One 6mL intra-articular injection left knee. Tolerated well.

Patient reports right knee (injected last week) feels slightly better but hard to tell yet.

================================================================================
DATE: October 21, 2024
FOLLOW-UP - Post hyaluronic acid series

Patient completed bilateral hyaluronic acid injections 8 weeks ago. Reports minimal improvement. Pain still 5-6/10 daily. Very frustrated. Really wants to avoid surgery - she's only 52.

Patient has been researching online and asking about PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injections. Says she read that PRP can actually help regenerate cartilage and provide longer-lasting relief than cortisone or hyaluronic acid. Has a friend who got PRP for her knee and "it completely fixed it."

Discussed PRP:
PROS: 
- Uses patient's own blood (low risk)
- Some studies show improvement in pain/function
- May provide longer relief than cortisone
- Possibly disease-modifying (though not proven)

CONS:
- Not FDA-approved for osteoarthritis specifically
- Considered experimental by most insurance - likely NOT COVERED
- Cost: ~$800-1000 per knee out of pocket
- Evidence is mixed - not all studies show benefit
- Not standardized (different protocols)

Patient understands insurance likely won't cover but wants to try anyway. She's exhausted all standard options and is desperate to avoid surgery. Willing to pay out of pocket if needed.

After lengthy discussion of risks, benefits, limitations of evidence, and costs, patient still wants to proceed.

PLAN: 
1. Will check with insurance for coverage (unlikely but will try)
2. If approved, schedule bilateral PRP injections
3. If denied, patient may choose to proceed as self-pay

Patient signed informed consent for PRP therapy acknowledging:
- Experimental/investigational nature
- Lack of FDA approval for this indication  
- Insurance may not cover
- No guarantee of benefit
- Alternative covered treatments available

Date: October 22, 2024

Submitted request to Cigna for:
CPT 0232T x 2 units (bilateral PRP injections)

Clinical justification letter attached documenting:
- 3 year history of progressive bilateral knee osteoarthritis

- Failed conservative treatments:
  * NSAIDs (ibuprofen, then meloxicam) - minimal relief
  * Physical therapy (8 weeks, 2x/week) - minimal improvement  
  * Weight reduction (lost 8 lbs)
  * Intra-articular corticosteroid injections - temporary relief only (6 weeks)
  * Hyaluronic acid injection series - minimal benefit
- Patient too young (52) for total knee replacement, wants to defer surgery
- PRP may provide disease-modifying effect and longer symptom relief

Request submitted 10/22/2024. Waiting for response.

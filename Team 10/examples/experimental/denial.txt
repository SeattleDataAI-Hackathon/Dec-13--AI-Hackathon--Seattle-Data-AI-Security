Date of Service: November 8, 2024
Provider: Advanced Pain Management Center - Dr. Thomas Wright

CLAIM DETAILS:
Procedure: Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Injection, bilateral knees

Diagnosis: M17.0 (Bilateral primary osteoarthritis of knee)
Billed Amount: $1,800.00 (2 units)

DENIAL REASON: EXPERIMENTAL/INVESTIGATIONAL - NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY

This claim has been denied after clinical review by our Medical Director. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee are considered experimental and investigational and are not covered under your health plan.

CLINICAL RATIONALE FOR DENIAL:

Based on review of current peer-reviewed medical literature and evidence-based clinical guidelines:

1. **Insufficient Evidence**: While some studies suggest short-term symptom improvement with PRP injections for knee osteoarthritis, there is insufficient high-quality evidence demonstrating long-term efficacy, disease modification, or superiority to established treatments (e.g., corticosteroid injections, hyaluronic acid, physical therapy).

2. **Lack of Standardization**: There is no consensus on PRP preparation methods, concentration protocols, injection frequency, or patient selection criteria. The wide variability in treatment protocols makes it impossible to establish evidence-based clinical guidelines.

3. **Not FDA Approved**: PRP devices used for musculoskeletal conditions are not FDA-approved for osteoarthritis treatment specifically. The FDA considers these devices to be in investigational status for this indication.

4. **Position Statements**: Major professional organizations including the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) have issued "inconclusive" recommendations for PRP use in knee osteoarthritis due to insufficient evidence.

5. **Coverage Policy**: Per Cigna Medical Coverage Policy #0531 - "Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy for Orthopedic Conditions" (effective 10/15/2024), PRP injections for knee osteoarthritis are considered investigational and not medically necessary.

APPROVED ALTERNATIVES:

Your plan covers the following evidence-based treatments for knee osteoarthritis:
- Physical therapy and therapeutic exercise
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
- Intra-articular corticosteroid injections
- Intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections  
- Total knee replacement surgery (when conservative measures fail)

AMOUNT DUE: $1,800.00 - This service is not covered. Your provider may bill you for this service.

DOB: 03/15/1968 (Age 56)
PROVIDER: Dr. Robert Kim, MD - Advanced Orthopedic Specialists

================================================================================
DATE: August 5, 2024
VISIT TYPE: New Patient Consultation

CHIEF COMPLAINT: Right shoulder pain x 6 months, worsening past 2 weeks

HPI: 
56 y/o right-hand dominant female with progressive right shoulder pain. Initially started 6 months ago after attempting to catch falling ladder at home. Pain gradually worsened. Limited ROM. Difficulty with overhead activities, can't reach top shelf or wash hair. Night pain preventing sleep. Has tried ibuprofen OTC with minimal relief.

EXAM:
Limited active ROM - forward flexion to 110 degrees (should be 180), abduction to 90 degrees
Positive Neer impingement sign
Positive Hawkins-Kennedy test  
4/5 strength with external rotation
Significant pain with resisted supraspinatus testing (empty can test)

X-RAY (performed today): No fracture, mild AC joint arthritis, no significant glenohumeral arthritis

ASSESSMENT: Likely rotator cuff tear vs severe tendinopathy

PLAN:
1. Order MRI right shoulder to evaluate rotator cuff
2. Start PT referral - 6 weeks
3. Consider cortisone injection if PT not helping
4. Follow up after MRI

MRI RIGHT SHOULDER - RADIOLOGY REPORT

TECHNIQUE: MRI right shoulder without contrast

FINDINGS:
- ROTATOR CUFF: High-grade partial-thickness tear of the supraspinatus tendon involving approximately 80% of tendon thickness. Tear measures 1.8 cm in AP dimension. Retraction of approximately 1 cm.
- Additional interstitial tearing of infraspinatus tendon
- Moderate tendinosis of subscapularis, no full-thickness tear
- LABRUM: Intact
- BICEPS TENDON: Mild tendinosis, tendon intact
- AC JOINT: Mild degenerative changes
- BONE MARROW: No edema or acute abnormality

IMPRESSION:
1. High-grade partial-thickness rotator cuff tear, supraspinatus (80% thickness, 1.8cm)
2. Interstitial tearing infraspinatus
3. Given extent and retraction, likely will progress to complete tear - surgical candidate

VISIT TYPE: Follow-up - MRI Results

Reviewed MRI with patient. High-grade partial tear, very close to full thickness. With retraction and her symptoms, conservative treatment unlikely to provide lasting relief. At her age and activity level, tear will likely progress to complete tear.

Discussed options:
1. Continue PT/conservative care - but prognosis poor given tear size
2. Surgical repair - arthroscopic rotator cuff repair

Patient reports PT not helping much (attended 3 sessions so far). Pain worse, now can't sleep on right side at all. Taking ibuprofen 600mg TID. Still unable to work (she's a dental hygienist - needs overhead arm use).

Patient very motivated for surgery. Unable to perform her job duties. Wants to proceed with surgical repair.

PLAN: Schedule arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Will coordinate with surgery scheduler.

DR. KIM ON-CALL NOTE

Spoke with ED attending Dr. Martinez re: Maria Rodriguez. Known high-grade partial RC tear, now acute complete tear after mechanical fall today. Was already scheduled for surgery 9/22.

Given acute complete tear with loss of function, this is now urgent indication. Keeping surgery date as scheduled - waiting longer risks further retraction and worse surgical outcome.

Called surgery center - confirmed 9/22 8AM still available.

Called patient - confirmed she understands urgency and will proceed with surgery as scheduled.

Note: Authorization was submitted 9/18 but not yet received approval. Given urgent clinical change (acute complete tear), proceeding with surgery. Will have office submit updated clinical documentation to insurance first thing Monday morning (9/23 - day after surgery).

================================================================================
DATE: September 23, 2024 - 8:15 AM
OFFICE NOTE - Authorization Follow-up

Received approval from Anthem this morning for surgery - approved for CPT 29827. Approval date 9/24/2024.

Called insurance to explain surgery was performed 9/22 due to urgent clinical deterioration (acute complete tear on 9/20). 

Rep said claim may deny for lack of pre-auth even though procedure approved. Recommended appeal with ER records showing urgent indication.

Documented in chart for billing department.

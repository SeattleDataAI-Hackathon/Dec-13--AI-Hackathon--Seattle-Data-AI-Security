CLAIM DENIAL NOTICE

Date: October 8, 2024
Patient Name: Maria Rodriguez
Patient ID: 874-92-3421
Claim Number: CLM-2024-98331
Service Date: September 22, 2024
Provider: Advanced Orthopedic Specialists, Dr. Robert Kim

CLAIM DETAILS:
Procedure: Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair, Right Shoulder
CPT Code: 29827
Diagnosis: M75.121 (Complete rotator cuff tear, right shoulder, not specified as traumatic)
Billed Amount: $18,450.00

DENIAL REASON: AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED - SERVICE NOT AUTHORIZED

This claim has been denied because the procedure was performed without prior authorization from Anthem Blue Cross as required under your policy provisions.

POLICY REQUIREMENT:
Per Section 7(b) of your Summary Plan Description, all non-emergency surgical procedures require pre-authorization at least 5 business days prior to the scheduled surgery date. Pre-authorization must be obtained by the provider through our utilization management department.

CLAIM REVIEW FINDINGS:
• Authorization request submitted: September 20, 2024 at 4:47 PM
• Surgery performed: September 22, 2024 at 8:00 AM  
• Authorization decision issued: September 24, 2024 (APPROVED - after service already performed)

Our system shows the authorization request was submitted only 1 business day before surgery, not the required 5 business days. While the procedure would have been medically appropriate and was subsequently approved, the policy requirement for timely pre-authorization was not met at the time of service.

MEMBER LIABILITY: $18,450.00

APPEAL RIGHTS:
You may appeal this denial if you believe there were extenuating circumstances that prevented timely authorization, such as:
- Emergency or urgent clinical situation requiring expedited surgery
- Administrative error by provider's office
- Delay in obtaining necessary diagnostic studies

Appeals must be submitted within 180 days to:
Anthem Blue Cross Appeals Department
PO Box 105187
Atlanta, GA 30348-5187

Include any supporting documentation regarding the timing and urgency of your surgery.

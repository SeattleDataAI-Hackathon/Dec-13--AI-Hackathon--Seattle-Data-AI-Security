CLAIM DENIAL NOTICE

Date: November 28, 2024
Patient Name: James Mitchell
Patient ID: PAT-2024-91234
Claim Number: CLM-2024-56789
Service Date: November 1, 2024
Provider: Dr. Lisa Anderson, Family Medicine Associates

CLAIM DETAILS:
Procedure: Annual Preventive Examination
CPT Code: 99385 (Preventive visit, 18-39 years)
ICD-10 Code: R51 (Headache)
Billed Amount: $285.00

DENIAL REASON: Coding Error - Preventive Service Billed as Diagnostic

Your claim has been processed with patient responsibility applied because the diagnosis code submitted does not align with preventive care guidelines.

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
The claim was submitted with CPT code 99385 (preventive medicine service for patient age 18-39) but was paired with ICD-10 code R51 (Headache), which is a diagnostic code indicating treatment of a medical problem.

Under the Affordable Care Act, preventive services must be coded with appropriate preventive diagnosis codes (typically Z codes such as Z00.00 for general adult medical examination without abnormal findings).

RESULT:
Because the diagnosis code indicates diagnostic/treatment services rather than preventive screening, the claim does not qualify for 100% coverage under preventive care benefits. Patient copayment and deductible apply.

AMOUNT DUE FROM PATIENT: $285.00

CORRECTIVE ACTION:
If this was intended as a preventive visit, please resubmit the claim with the appropriate ICD-10 Z code (e.g., Z00.00). If the patient had complaints addressed during the visit, the claim may need to be split or modified with appropriate modifiers to separate preventive and diagnostic components.

Appeal deadline: December 28, 2024

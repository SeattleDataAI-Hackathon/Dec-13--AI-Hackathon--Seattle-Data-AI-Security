StorySprout AI — Children’s Story Generator
An AI‑powered story creation tool for parents, teachers, and caregivers.

🌱 Overview
StorySprout AI turns simple user inputs (story idea, characters, moral, setting) into a 5–6 page illustrated children's story, complete with:

✨ Kid‑safe story text (simple vocabulary, positive tone)

🎨 AI‑generated illustrations per page

🔊 Optional text‑to‑speech narration in child‑friendly voices

🛡️ Built‑in safety checks & content moderation

⚡ Fast and light architecture (perfect for hackathons)

This project was developed by a team of four in a 5‑hour hackathon.

Workflow
User enters story idea → POST /api/story/generate

Backend:

Validates input

Runs moderation

Builds structured LLM prompt

Returns story JSON with pages & image prompts

Frontend displays text immediately

Page images are fetched on demand → POST /api/story/{id}/page/{page}/image

Narration audio generated on demand → POST /api/story/{id}/page/{page}/tts

This approach keeps things fast and avoids waiting for images or audio before showing the story.
